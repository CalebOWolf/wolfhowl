<p> Rest In Peace Xavy 4/28/2020</p>
<p> Xavy was a very bright, kind, and caring individual who had a great passion for others. <br> His kindness had spread to other people and had met someone who was very caring of others as well. <br> May Xavy rest well and that his memories are always remembered! </p>
<br>
<p> Xavy was a friend to those whom knew him. Xavy was someone that we all cared about as we all knew him as a wonderful person, the people he cared for had been well treated and shaped into whom they are today. this leads to his first encounter with someone named Bandalito. He met him and things were perfect, almost though..that is til the morning happened, he was out on the road on his motorcycle when a fatal encounter had happened to himself.. What we know is that he died later on that day at the hospital and that we all know that when this happened Bandy was broken..we sadly dont know what happened after today as we do know one thing though, he disappeared for least a couple of weeks to better himself. Bandy came back on May 16 2020 to stream to us all about Xavy and himself, he was at his parents place when he streamed so he was in comfort of his own family to be there for himself though we all were there for himself that day thankfully. we all knew how he'd be that day so we all took it easy.. why do i tell this? Besides Bandy knowing Xavy the best....I was also one of Xavy's dear friends, for about a year 2019 then into 2020. I still remember the march day that i met himself, we talked a while on and off though but very much til he met Bandy.. This is the day of when Xavy died in our hands..It will stay that way til we cross paths again.. Xavy..if you're still here with us..we miss yourself..dearly....</p>
